VERSION 0.3

  Nothing more than a clean-up of the project tree.  Although the autotools
  setup was working OK it was more confusing than helpful.  People tend to
  install these kinds of things in a much more ad hoc manner anyway.



VERSION 0.2


  Total rewrite of the logic.  Much easier to specify grammars, as the need for
  commas and full-stops has been lifted.   Furthermore, there is now an
  alternative way of specifying non-terminals, using '-pairs instead.  The
  output is a lot nicer now as well, albeit not as compact as before.



VERSION 0.1


  Initial release, nothing much to report here.
